Questions :

There are three party's involved 
1) Application integration components 
2) CEERS camel component   --> will call CEERSCSCOMP 
3) CEERS system


From Integration we are using CEERSCSCOMP(CEERS camel component) to push the audit,state and notification messages to CEERS system .


Ex : Take an sample route like file to FTP 

<Route>
<From uri=file://C:/Temp/Data>
<to uri=CEERSCSCOMP?eventype=audit;messagetype=heartbeatmessage;>
<to uri=ftp://D:remote/data>

Above route sends file to remote FTP location while doing so its pushing the 
message to CEERS system via CEERS camel component CEERSCSCOMP .
CEERSCSCOMP is the custom camel component , it does the message transformation 
to CEERS message format and calls the CEERS service to post the message.


original message format :

From File :

<heartbeat>
<timestamp date="15-2-2016" type="online">
</heartbeat>

After transformation to CEERS format by CEERS camel component 

Final CEERS format :

<CEERS messagetype="heartbeatmessage" eventye="audit">
<payload>CDATA[<heartbeat>
<timestamp date="15-2-2016" type="online">
</heartbeat>]
</Payload>
</CEERS>




What is the buisness functionality of ceers system (Not CEERS camel component).
What is the message format / schema definition does the CEERS accept ?
If possible share one example message sent to CEERS system ?

How is the CEERS system exposed ,means the protocol used to access the CEERS system 
like http , tcp or JMS .



blueprint.xml you shared with me is not an complete one I guess ,  it might be splitted into two files 
check that as well .

Understanding  of existing route

Step 1:
From integration routes we will push the message to ceers camel component with the payload and uri paramters 
like messagtype, component name , severity etc .


Step 2:

Internally camel ceers component will pick the message from vm endpoint and based on
xpath ,payload routed to particular queues like audit, state .

Step 3:

From those Queues again message unmarshalled , transformed and sent to remote queues like
audit , state.

Info: 

They used XA JMS resources for distributed transaction . 



Things I have done today :

Working on adding the CEERS camel component to simple route to see
how the CEERS component works internally .
